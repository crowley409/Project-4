# Project-4
# The main focus of this project revolved around healthcare and brain tumors.
# The dataset used provided information that indicted whether there was a brain tumor present or not, following with various factors of measure. 
# The projectâ€™s aim was to identify which factor or factors can possibly contribute to having a brain tumor present, as well as vice versa, not having a brain tumor present.
# Using various machine learning algorithms and models
# Models used: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, Ridge Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting.
# Conclusions: 
# The dataset showcases large differences in the variables between Group 0 and Group 1, indicating statistical and practical relevance. 
# The 4 models we found most successful with our algorithm were Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.
